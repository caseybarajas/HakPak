## üß∞ Components

### Required Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB RAM recommended)
- Flipper Zero
- 10,000-20,000mAh Power Bank
- Custom 3D Printed Case (files included)
- microSD Card (64GB+ recommended)
- Small USB hub (optional)
- Heat sinks/cooling solution for Pi
- **Jumper wires** for GPIO connection (optional, if using UART instead of USB)

### Software Stack

- Kali Linux ARM for Raspberry Pi
- Flask/Python Web Application Backend
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive frontend
- Flipper Zero integration scripts
- Power management utilities

## üìã Installation

### Preparing the Raspberry Pi

1. Download and flash the latest Kali Linux ARM image to your microSD card:
```bash
# Download the latest Kali Linux ARM image
wget https://kali.download/arm-images/kali-2023.1/kali-linux-2023.1-raspberry-pi-arm64.img.xz

# Flash to microSD card (replace sdX with your device)
sudo dd if=kali-linux-2023.1-raspberry-pi-arm64.img.xz of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

2. Boot your Raspberry Pi with the flashed SD card and perform initial setup:
```bash
# Update the system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/caseybarajas/hakpak.git
cd hakpak
```

3. Run the installation script:
```bash
# Make the installation script executable
sudo chmod +x scripts/install.sh

# Run the installation script
sudo ./scripts/install.sh
```

The installation script will:
1. Install required packages
2. Configure the WiFi access point
3. Set up the web interface
4. Configure the Flipper Zero connection
5. Enable services to start on boot

### Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter issues during installation, use the verification script to diagnose problems:

```bash
sudo chmod +x scripts/verify_install.sh
sudo ./scripts/verify_install.sh
```

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Masked services**: If hostapd or dnsmasq are masked, unmask them manually:
```bash
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl unmask dnsmasq
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq
```

2. **Service failures**: Check service logs for detailed error messages:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u hakpak -f
sudo journalctl -u hostapd -f
```

### Connecting the Flipper Zero

The Flipper Zero can be connected either via USB or UART:

#### USB Connection (Recommended)

1. Connect your Flipper Zero to the Raspberry Pi using a USB cable
2. Run the Flipper Zero setup script:
```bash
sudo chmod +x scripts/setup_flipper.sh
sudo ./scripts/setup_flipper.sh
```

3. If the Flipper Zero is not automatically detected, use the fix script:
```bash
sudo chmod +x scripts/fix_flipper_detection.sh
sudo ./scripts/fix_flipper_detection.sh
```

#### UART Connection (Alternative)

For UART connection, follow this wiring diagram:

| Raspberry Pi (GPIO) | Flipper Zero    | Function |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Pin 6 (GND)         | GND Pin (18)    | Ground   |
| Pin 8 (GPIO14/TXD)  | RX Pin (14/PB7) | Data TX  |
| Pin 10 (GPIO15/RXD) | TX Pin (13/PB6) | Data RX  |
| Pin 4 (5V)          | 5V Pin (Optional)| Power    |

For a visual connection diagram, see the [detailed pinout documentation](docs/pinout.md).

ASCII Connection Diagram:
```
Raspberry Pi   Flipper Zero    
--------------+--------------
GPIO 8 (TXD) -|-> Pin 14 (RX)
GPIO 10 (RXD) <-|- Pin 13 (TX)
Pin 6 (GND) ----|-- Pin 18 (GND)
Pin 4 (5V) -----|-- 5V (Optional)
```

To enable UART:
```bash
sudo raspi-config
# Navigate to Interface Options > Serial Port
# Disable serial login shell, but enable serial hardware
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Starting the System

1. Power on the system by connecting the battery pack
2. Wait approximately 60 seconds for boot sequence
3. Connect to the HakPak WiFi network (default SSID: `hakpak`)
   - Default password: `pentestallthethings`
4. Access the web interface at `http://hakpak.local` or `http://192.168.4.1`

### Web Interface

The web interface provides access to all functionality:

- **Dashboard**: System status, battery levels, active connections
- **Kali Tools**: Access to common Kali Linux pentesting tools
- **Flipper Control**: Interface with Flipper Zero functions
  - IR control (transmit and record signals)
  - RFID operations (read, write, clone)
  - SubGHz functions (receive and transmit on various frequencies)
- **Scan Tools**: WiFi, Bluetooth, and RF scanning utilities
- **Settings**: Configure network, services, and system settings

### Flipper Zero Integration Features

- **IR Control**: Send and record infrared signals for TVs, ACs, and other IR devices
- **RFID/NFC**: Read, write and emulate RFID cards and tags
- **SubGHz**: Capture and replay Sub-GHz signals from various devices
- **GPIO Control**: Interface with external hardware via GPIO pins
- **iButton**: Read and emulate iButton/1-Wire devices

## üîß Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **System doesn't boot**: Check battery level and connections
- **Web interface not accessible**: Verify WiFi connection and IP address
  - Run `ifconfig` to check your network configuration
  - Try accessing via IP address (192.168.4.1) if hostname doesn't work
- **Flipper Zero not detected**: Check USB connection and run `sudo ./scripts/fix_flipper_detection.sh`
  - If using UART, verify the wiring connections
  - Check `dmesg` output for connection issues
- **WiFi access point not working**: Run `sudo systemctl status hostapd` and `sudo systemctl status dnsmasq`
  - If services are masked, run `sudo systemctl unmask hostapd` and `sudo systemctl unmask dnsmasq`
  - If services fail to start, check configuration files in `/etc/hostapd/` and `/etc/`

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Hardware Expansion

The system can be expanded with additional hardware:

- GPS module for geolocation
- Additional antennas for extended range
- SDR (Software Defined Radio) for advanced RF capabilities
- External storage for increased capacity

### Software Customization

The HakPak web application is built on a modular Flask architecture:

- Controllers are located in `app/controllers/`
- Templates are in `app/templates/`
- Static files (CSS, JS) are in `app/static/`
- Configuration files are in `config/`

To add a new feature:
1. Create a new controller in `app/controllers/`
2. Add your template in `app/templates/`
3. Register your blueprint in `app/__init__.py`
