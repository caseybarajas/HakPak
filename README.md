## üåü Overview

HakPak is an all-in-one portable penetration testing platform that combines the software capabilities of a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux with the hardware interaction features of a Flipper Zero, all in a compact, battery-powered package controllable via a web interface.

Designed for security professionals and ethical hackers, HakPak provides a comprehensive toolkit for both wireless and physical penetration testing in a discreet, backpack-friendly form factor.

## ‚ú® Features

- **All-in-One Solution**: Combines Kali Linux capabilities with Flipper Zero's hardware hacking features
- **Web-Based Control Interface**: Operate all tools through a unified browser interface
- **Detachable Flipper Zero**: Quick-release mechanism for IR operations
- **Wireless Capabilities**: Built-in WiFi, Bluetooth, and RF scanning/transmission
- **Compact Design**: Easily fits in a backpack or laptop bag
- **Modular Architecture**: Expandable with additional sensors and hardware
- **Real-time System Monitoring**: View battery, CPU, memory, and temperature stats
- **Integrated Tool Management**: Launch and control common Kali tools directly from the web interface

## üß∞ Components

### Required Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB RAM recommended)
- Flipper Zero
- 10,000-20,000mAh Power Bank
- microSD Card (64GB+ recommended)
- WiFi adapter (built-in or external)
- Optional: Custom 3D Printed Case (files included)
- Optional: Small USB hub
- Optional: Heat sinks/cooling solution for Pi

### Software Stack

- Kali Linux ARM for Raspberry Pi
- Flask/Python Web Application Backend
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive frontend
- Flipper Zero integration scripts
- Power management utilities

## üìã Installation

### Quick Installation (Recommended)

1. Start with a fresh installation of Kali Linux on your Raspberry Pi

2. Clone the repository and run the setup script:
```bash
# Update the system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/caseybarajas/hakpak.git
cd hakpak

# Run the automated setup script
sudo chmod +x scripts/hakpak_setup.sh
sudo ./scripts/hakpak_setup.sh
```

The setup script will automatically:
- Install all required dependencies
- Configure the WiFi access point
- Set up network routing
- Configure all services
- Create the web interface
- Set up Flipper Zero connection

3. After setup completes (or after a reboot), connect to the `hakpak` WiFi network:
   - Password: `pentestallthethings`
   - Access the web interface at `http://192.168.4.1`

### Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If you prefer to install components manually:

1. Install required packages:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq nginx python3-pip python3-venv git usbutils rfkill iw wireless-tools
```

2. Configure network services:
```bash
# Configure hostapd
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
# Configure dnsmasq
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
# Enable services
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd dnsmasq
```

3. Set up the Python environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv /opt/hakpak/venv
/opt/hakpak/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create and enable the HakPak service:
```bash
sudo cp config/hakpak.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable hakpak
sudo systemctl start hakpak
```

See the [detailed installation guide](docs/installation.md) for complete manual installation instructions.

## üöÄ Usage

### Connecting to HakPak

1. Power on your Raspberry Pi
2. Connect to the `hakpak` WiFi network
   - Password: `pentestallthethings`
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`
4. Log in with default credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `hakpak`

### Web Interface

The web interface provides easy access to all functionality:

- **Dashboard**: System status and monitoring
- **Kali Tools**: Access to common Kali Linux tools
- **Flipper Zero**: Control your Flipper Zero device
  - IR operations (transmit, record)
  - RFID operations (read, write, emulate)
  - SubGHz functionality
- **Network Tools**: WiFi/Bluetooth scanning and attack tools
- **Settings**: Configure device and connection settings

### Connecting Your Flipper Zero

Simply connect your Flipper Zero to the Raspberry Pi via USB. The system will automatically detect and configure the device. For detailed setup, see [Flipper Zero setup guide](docs/flipper_setup.md).

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, try these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Run the health check script**:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/health_check.sh
```

2. **Check all services are running**:
```bash
sudo systemctl status hostapd dnsmasq nginx hakpak
```

3. **Restart the services**:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart hostapd dnsmasq nginx hakpak
```

4. **Verify WiFi interface**:
```bash
sudo iw dev
```

5. **If nothing else works, reboot**:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

For more detailed troubleshooting, see [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## üîÑ Updates

To update HakPak to the latest version:

```bash
cd ~/hakpak
git pull
sudo ./scripts/hakpak_setup.sh
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Configuration Options

Primary settings can be modified in the `config/` directory:
- `config/hakpak.conf`: Main application settings
- `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`: WiFi access point settings
- `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`: DHCP and DNS settings

### Adding Custom Features

HakPak follows a modular architecture for easy extension:
- Add new controllers in `app/controllers/`
- Add new templates in `app/templates/`
